## Primitive Data Types

- `number`
- `string`
- `boolean`
- `null`
- `undefined`
- `symbol`
- `bigint`
- `object`
- `never`
- `any`
- `unknown`

```typescript
let a: number = 1;
let b: string = "hello";
let c: boolean = true;
let d: null = null;
let e: undefined = undefined;
let f: symbol = Symbol("foo");
let g: bigint = 100n;
let h: object = { foo: "bar" };
let i: never = (() => {
  throw new Error("error");
})();
let j: any = 1;
let k: unknown = 1;

// example
a = 2; // ok
a = "hello"; // error
b = "world"; // ok
b = 2; // error
c = true; // ok
c = false; // ok
d = null; // ok
d = undefined; // error
e = undefined; // ok
e = null; // error
f = Symbol("foo"); // ok
f = Symbol("bar"); // ok
g = 100n; // ok
g = 100; // error
h = { foo: "bar" }; // ok
h = { bar: "foo" }; // ok
```

## `type` Aliases

‚ú® In TypeScript, a type alias is a way to give a new name to a type. It's like creating a new identifier that you can use in place of an existing type.

‚öíÔ∏è `type` aliases are used when you want to avoid typing long type annotations, encapsulate complex types into a single identifier, or create more meaningful and readable code. They are particularly useful when working with complex types that are used repeatedly throughout your code.

üí°`type` aliases help to make your code more readable and maintainable. They allow you to encapsulate complex types into a single identifier, which can make your code easier to understand. They also help to reduce redundancy in your code by allowing you to define a type once and then reuse it throughout your code

```typescript
// Primitive type
type ID = string;
type Name = string;

// Complex type
type User = {
  id: ID;
  name: Name;
  email: string;
};

// Union type
type WindowStates = "open" | "closed" | "minimized";

// Function type
type Callback = (error: Error, response: object) => void;

// Generic type
type Container<T> = { value: T };
```

## Literal Types

‚ú® In TypeScript, a literal type is a type that represents exactly one value. For example, the literal type `"hello"` only represents the string `"hello"`. Similarly, `2` is a numeric literal type that only represents the number `2`. Literal types are often used in conjunction with union types to describe a value that can be a set of specific strings or numbers.

‚öíÔ∏è Literal types are used when you want to restrict a value to a specific set of possibilities. They are often used in situations where a variable can only take on a limited number of known values.

üí°Literal types help to make your code more type-safe by restricting the possible values a variable can take. This can help to catch potential bugs at compile-time rather than at runtime.

```typescript
// String literal type
type Direction = "north" | "east" | "south" | "west";

// Numeric literal type
type DiceRoll = 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6;

// Boolean literal type
type HasSides = true;
```

```typescript
function move(distance: number, direction: Direction) {
  console.log(`Moving ${distance} meters ${direction}`);
}

move(10, "north"); // ok
move(10, "down"); // error
```

### Literal Types For Returns

‚ú® Literal Types For Returns refers to the practice of using literal types as the return type of a function. This means that the function is expected to return a specific, singular value.

```typescript
type Direction = "north" | "south" | "east" | "west";

function getDirection(): Direction {
  return "north";
}
```

```typescript
type LiteralFunction = (a: number, b: number) => number;

const add: LiteralFunction = (a, b) => a + b;
```

## Index Signatures

‚ú® In TypeScript, an index signature is a way to define a type that allows for any property name on an object to be used as a key to access a property value. It's a way to describe types of objects that are not known at design time.

‚öíÔ∏è Index signatures are used when you want to create objects that have some set of properties that are not known until runtime. They are often used when working with objects that act as dictionaries or maps.

üí° Index signatures provide a way to define the type of an object that can have any number of properties of a certain type. Without index signatures, it would be difficult to describe the types of these kinds of objects in TypeScript.

- String Index Signature: `type StringIndexSignature = { [key: string]: string };`

  ```typescript
  type StringIndexSignature = { [key: string]: string };

  const obj: StringIndexSignature = {
    name: "John",
    age: "30",
    city: "New York",
  };
  ```

- Number Index Signature: `type NumberIndexSignature = { [key: number]: string };`

  ```typescript
  type NumberIndexSignature = { [key: number]: string };

  const obj: NumberIndexSignature = {
    0: "Sizar",
    1: "30",
    2: "New York",
  };
  ```

- Mixed Index Signature: `type MixedIndexSignature = { [key: string]: string | number };`

  ```typescript
  type MixedIndexSignature = { [key: string]: string | number };

  const obj: MixedIndexSignature = {
    name: "Sizar",
    age: 30,
    city: "New York",
  };
  ```

- Index Signature for Function Return Types : `type FunctionIndexSignature = { [key: string]: () => string };`

  ```typescript
  type FunctionIndexSignature = { [key: string]: () => string };

  const obj: FunctionIndexSignature = {
    name: () => "Sizar",
    age: () => "30",
    city: () => "New York",
  };
  ```

- Index Signature with readonly Modifier: `type ReadonlyIndexSignature = { readonly [key: string]: string };`

  ```typescript
  type ReadonlyIndexSignature = { readonly [key: string]: string };

  const obj: ReadonlyIndexSignature = {
    name: "Sizar",
    age: "30",
    city: "New York",
  };

  obj.name = "Jane"; // error
  ```

## `typeof` Operator

‚ú® The `typeof` operator is a unary operator that returns a string indicating the type of the unevaluated operand. In JavaScript, it can return "`number`", "`string`", "`boolean`", "`undefined`", "`function`", "`object`", "`symbol`", or "`bigint`". In TypeScript, `typeof` can also be used as a type query operator to obtain the type of a variable, property, or other value.

‚öíÔ∏è The `typeof` operator helps to make your code more robust by allowing you to check the type of a variable before performing operations on it. In TypeScript, it allows you to create types based on the types of existing variables, which can help to reduce redundancy and improve type safety.

- Person Type Alias: If you have a `person` object, you can create a `Person` type that has the same structure as the person object.

  ```typescript
  const person = {
    name: "Sizar",
    age: 30,
  };

  type Person = typeof person;

  const person_x: Person = {
    name: "Sizar",
    age: 30,
    motto: "Hello World", // error
  };
  ```

- Function Type Alias: If you have a `log` function, you can create a `Log` type that has the same structure as the log function.

  ```typescript
  const log = (message: string) => {
    console.log(message);
  };

  type Log = typeof log;

  const log_x: Log = (message: string) => {
    console.log(message);
    console.log(message);
  };
  ```

- Enum Type Alias: If you have a `Direction` enum, you can create a `DirectionType` type that has the same structure as the `Direction` enum.

  ```typescript
  enum Direction {
    North,
    South,
    East,
    West,
  }

  type DirectionType = typeof Direction;

  const direction: DirectionType = {
    North: 0,
    South: 1,
    East: 2,
    West: 3,
  };
  ```

## Indexed Types

‚ú® In TypeScript, indexed types (also known as indexed access types or lookup types) allow you to get the type of a property at a specific index of a type. This is particularly useful when working with tuple or array types, or types with a known set of properties.

‚öíÔ∏è Indexed types are used when you want to get the type of a property at a specific index of a type. They are often used when working with tuple or array types, or types with a known set of properties.

üí° Indexed types help to make your code more type-safe by allowing you to get the type of a property at a specific index of a type. This can help to catch potential bugs at compile-time rather than at runtime.

- Accessing Tuple Types: `type First = [string, number][0];`

  ```typescript
  type TupleType = [string, number, boolean];
  type First = TupleType[0];

  const first: First = "Sizar";
  ```

- Accessing Array Types: `type First = string[];`

  ```typescript
  type First = string[];
  const first: First = ["Sizar", "30"];

  type ArrayType = number[];
  type ElementType = ArrayType[number];
  ```

- Accessing Object Property Types: `type First = { name: string }["name"];`

  ```typescript
  type First = { name: string }["name"];
  const first: First = "Sizar";

  type ObjectType = { name: string; age: number };
  type NameType = ObjectType["name"]; // string
  ```

- Using with `keyof`: `type First = keyof { name: string };` You can use indexed types to access the type of a specific property of an object type.

  ```typescript
  type First = keyof { name: string };
  const first: First = "name";

  type ObjectType = { name: string; age: number };
  type AnyPropertyType = ObjectType[keyof ObjectType]; // string | number
  ```

- Using with `typeof`: `type First = typeof person["name"];`

  ```typescript
  const person = {
    name: "Sizar",
    age: 30,
  };

  type First = (typeof person)["name"];
  const first: First = "Sizar";
  ```

## `keyof` Operator

‚ú® The `keyof` operator in TypeScript is a type operator that produces a string or numeric literal union of the keys of an object type. It's used to capture the property names of an object type as a literal union type.

‚öíÔ∏è `keyof` is used when you want to create a type that represents the keys of another type. It's often used in conjunction with indexed types to create types that are based on the properties of existing types.

- Creating Key Types: `type Keys = keyof { name: string; age: number };`

  ```typescript
  type Keys = keyof { name: string; age: number };
  const keys: Keys = "name";
  ```

- Object Property Type Alias: This is a `keyof` type used with an indexed type to get the type of a specific property of an object type.

  ```typescript
  type ObjectType = { name: string; age: number };
  type NameType = ObjectType[keyof ObjectType]; // string | number
  ```

- Function Property Keys Type Alias: This is a `keyof` type that gets the keys of a function's properties.

  ```typescript
  type FunctionProperties = keyof Function; // "apply" | "arguments" | "bind" | "call" | "caller" | "length" | "name" | "toString" | "prototype"
  ```

## Generic Type Arguments

‚ú® In TypeScript, generic type arguments allow you to write reusable code that can work over a variety of types, rather than a single one. They are a way of defining functions, classes, or interfaces that can operate on different types, while still maintaining type safety.

‚öíÔ∏è Generic type arguments are used when you want to create reusable components that can work with any type, but still maintain type safety. They are often used in functions, classes, and interfaces.

üßµ The syntax for generic type arguments involves using angled brackets (`<` and `>`). Inside these brackets, you place a placeholder type (often `T` by convention, but it can be any valid identifier). This placeholder type can then be used as a type within the function, class, or interface.

```typescript
function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
  return arg;
}
```

- Naming: While `T` is a common placeholder name, you can use any valid identifier. If your generic takes multiple type arguments, it's common to use `T`, `U`, `V`, etc.

- Using Multiple Type Variables: You can use multiple type variables in a generic to work with functions or methods that take two or more arguments of different types.

  ```typescript
  function identity<T, U>(arg1: T, arg2: U): [T, U] {
    return [arg1, arg2];
  }
  ```

- Using Type Constraints: You can use type constraints in a generic to restrict the types that can be used with it. This is done by using the `extends` keyword.

  ```typescript
  function identity<T extends string>(arg: T): T {
    return arg;
  }
  ```

```typescript
const data = [
  {
    name: "John",
    age: 25,
  },
  {
    name: "Jane",
    age: 24,
  },
];

type Status = "ok" | "error" | "unauthorized" | "unauthenticated";
type Count = number;

const createResponse = <T>(status: Status, data: T, count: Count) => {
  return {
    status,
    data,
    count,
  };
};

const response = createResponse("unauthenticated", data, data.length);
```

### Multiple Generic Arguments

```typescript
function pair<T, U>(first: T, second: U): [T, U] {
  return [first, second];
}

let result = pair<string, number>("apple", 10);
```

## Generic Function Arguments

"Generic Type Arguments" and "Generic Function Arguments" are related concepts, but they refer to slightly different things:

- Generic Type Arguments refer to the types that you pass to a generic function, class, or interface. For example, in `Array<number>`, `number` is a generic type argument.
- Generic Function Arguments refer to the actual values that you pass to a generic function. For example, in `identity<number>(123)`, `123` is a generic function argument.

‚ú® Generic Function Arguments in TypeScript refers to the use of type variables as arguments in a function. This allows the function to handle a variety of types while maintaining type safety. The type variable is defined in the function declaration and can be used to type the function's arguments and return value.

‚öíÔ∏è Use Generic Function Arguments when you want to write a function that can handle a variety of types, but you still want to maintain type safety. This is useful when you want to write reusable code.

- Generic Identity Function:

  ```typescript
  function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
    return arg;
  }
  ```

- Generic Array Function:

  ```typescript
  function createArray<T>(length: number, value: T): Array<T> {
    let result: T[] = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
      result[i] = value;
    }
    return result;
  }
  let array = createArray<string>(3, "x");
  ```

- Generic Property Function:

  ```typescript
  function getProperty<T, K extends keyof T>(obj: T, key: K) {
    return obj[key];
  }
  let person = { name: "Sizar", age: 30 };
  let name = getProperty(person, "name");
  let age = getProperty(person, "age");
  ```

## Generic Type Constraints

‚ú® Generic type constraints allow you to restrict the types that can be used with a generic type. This is done by using the `extends` keyword to specify that a type must extend a certain type or implement a certain interface.

‚öíÔ∏è Generic type constraints are used when you want to restrict the types that can be used with a generic type. They are often used in functions, classes, and interfaces to ensure that the types used with them meet certain requirements.

- Use the `extends` keyword to define a constraint.

  ```typescript
  function identity<T extends string>(arg: T): T {
    return arg;
  }
  ```

- Use an interface to define a constraint.

  ```typescript
  interface HasLength {
    length: number;
  }

  function identity<T extends HasLength>(arg: T): T {
    console.log(arg.length);
    return arg;
  }
  ```

- Use multiple constraints by using an intersection type.

  ```typescript
  interface HasLength {
    length: number;
  }

  interface HasName {
    name: string;
  }

  function identity<T extends HasLength & HasName>(arg: T): T {
    console.log(arg.length);
    console.log(arg.name);
    return arg;
  }
  ```

## Default Generic Arguments

‚ú® Default generic arguments in TypeScript allow you to specify a default type for a generic type parameter. This means that if a type argument is not provided when using the generic type, the default type will be used instead.

‚öíÔ∏è Default generic arguments are used when you want to provide a default type for a generic type parameter. They are often used in functions, classes, and interfaces to provide a default type for a type parameter.

- Default Generic Argument in a Function:

  ```typescript
  function defaultArgFunction<T = number>(arg: T): T {
    return arg;
  }
  let output = defaultArgFunction("myString");
  let defaultOutput = defaultArgFunction();
  ```

- Default Generic Argument with Multiple Types:

  ```typescript
  function defaultArgsFunction<T = number, U = string>(
    arg1: T,
    arg2: U
  ): [T, U] {
    return [arg1, arg2];
  }
  let output = defaultArgsFunction<boolean, boolean>(true, false);
  let defaultOutput = defaultArgsFunction(); // T is number, U is string
  ```

## Mapped Object Types

‚ú® Mapped Object Types in TypeScript are a way to create new types from old ones by transforming properties. They are defined by the syntax `{ [K in Keys]: Type }`. Here, Keys can be a type representing a set of strings or numbers (like `"a" | "b"`), and `Type` is the type to be transformed.

‚öíÔ∏è Use Mapped Object Types when you want to create a new type based on the properties of an existing type, especially when you want to apply a certain transformation to the properties of the existing type.

üí° Mapped Object Types help to make your code more reusable and maintainable by allowing you to create new types based on the properties of existing types. They are often used in situations where you want to create a new type that is similar to an existing type, but with some modifications.

- Making All Properties Readonly:

  ```typescript
  type Readonly<T> = {
    readonly [K in keyof T]: T[K];
  };
  let person: Readonly<{ name: string; age: number }> = {
    name: "Sizar",
    age: 30,
  };
  ```

- Making All Properties Optional:

  ```typescript
  type Partial<T> = {
    [K in keyof T]?: T[K];
  };
  let person: Partial<{ name: string; age: number }> = {
    name: "Sizar",
  };
  ```

- Picking Certain Properties from a Type:

  ```typescript
  type Pick<T, K extends keyof T> = {
    [P in K]: T[P];
  };

  let person: Pick<{ name: string; age: number }, "name"> = {
    name: "Sizar",
  };
  ```

- Removing Certain Properties from a Type:

  ```typescript
  type Omit<T, K extends keyof T> = Pick<T, Exclude<keyof T, K>>;

  let person: Omit<{ name: string; age: number }, "name"> = {
    age: 30,
  };
  ```

```typescript
type ProductCategories = {
  electronics: "Electronics";
  clothing: "Clothing";
  books: "Books";
};

type ProductCategoryInfo<T> = {
  [K in keyof T]: T[K];
};

type Example = ProductCategoryInfo<ProductCategories>;

// `ProductCategories` and `Example` are indeed the same type. The `ProductCategoryInfo<T>` mapped type is essentially a pass-through that doesn't change the type in any way.

// The` ProductCategoryInfo<T>` mapped type might be more useful in a scenario where you want to apply some transformation to the properties of `T`. For example, if you wanted to make all properties optional, you could define `ProductCategoryInfo<T>`.
```

## Type Unions

‚ú® A type union in TypeScript is a way to define a type that can be one of several different types. It's a way to combine multiple types into a single type that can represent any of the individual types.

‚öíÔ∏è Use type unions when you want to define a type that can be one of several different types. They are often used in situations where a variable can take on multiple types, or when you want to create a more flexible type.

- Using Type Unions:

  ```typescript
  type ID = string | number;
  type Name = string;
  type Age = number;
  type User = { id: ID; name: Name; age: Age };
  ```

- Using Type Unions with Literal Types:

  ```typescript
  type Status = "ok" | "error" | "unauthorized" | "unauthenticated";
  type Count = number;
  type Response = { status: Status; data: any; count: Count };
  ```

- Using Type Unions with Object Types:

  ```typescript
  type User = { id: string; name: string };
  type Admin = { id: string; role: string };
  type Person = User | Admin;
  ```

- Using Type Unions with Function Types:

  ```typescript
  type Callback = (error: Error, response: object) => void;
  type PromiseCallback = (error: Error, response: object) => Promise<void>;
  type AnyCallback = Callback | PromiseCallback;

  let callback: AnyCallback = (error: Error, response: object) => {
    console.log(error, response);
  };
  ```

- Using Type Unions with Generic Types:

  ```typescript
  type Container<T> = { value: T };
  type NumberContainer = Container<number>;
  type StringContainer = Container<string>;
  type AnyContainer = NumberContainer | StringContainer;

  let container: AnyContainer = { value: "hello" };
  ```
